Setting Up the Chat App
To use the chat application there is a very specific setup that must be followed for it to run correctly. First run “runServer”, once the server has been setup and that information displayed on the GUI, run “runClient” to connect to the chat server. 
Using the Chat App and Hearing Sound Effects
	At this point the user should be connected to the server via their client. As the client opens you will hear the first sound effect, a sign that the client opened. Type in either 1 or 2 to choose a channel to enter into. Things to note where the chat application itself excels: auto scrolling to the bottom of chat after any update, a notification noise after any updates to the chat, a neat coloring of the chat, and live updates when a new user enters or leaves the chat channel. After choosing a channel the user has the opportunity to take advantage of the extra features available in this application. 
Using the Chat Bot
Extra features such as the chat bot or the game. The chat bot features premade  phrases and access to the game through it. To access the chat bot use “!” before using a keyword that will trigger a response. To see what keywords trigger a response from the bot type !help inside of the client after connecting to a channel and the bot will list out the keywords. Something to notice about the chat bot is that it’s primarily just the beginning of what could be extended into a larger project. Due to time constraints the bot is not what would be an ideal completed version. The most important of the commands to the chat bot is !play, when input it brings up an in house version of rock, paper, scissors that can be played versus a computer.
Playing The Game
	To play the game type !play into the connected client in either chat channel. A new window should open titled “SHELDON GAME”. The game is an edition of rock paper scissors with five separate options. To actually play the game type in an integer value in the box next to “How many turns would you like to play?”, then click the “Start” button. At this point the user can choose their move via the drop down menu accessed under the “How many turns would you like to play?” area. The bot will make its move and display who won after the user chooses their move and clicks “move”. The user is free to continue playing until turns remaining hits 0, at which point the user will no longer be able to play.
